# OpenCharity Drupal Theme
OpenCharity is an open source theme for Drupal 7 created by Christian Ezeani. It uses SCSS, HTML5, and Gulp for all tasks.


## Getting Started
To begin using this theme, follow the steps below to get started:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/christianezeani/opencharity-drupal-theme.git`
2. Navigate into the project folder: `cd opencharity-drupal-theme`
3. Install nodejs dev dependencies for Gulp: `npm install`
4. Build the theme's javascript and CSS using Gulp: `gulp build` or `npm run build`

Once you've completed the steps above a new zip archive, `build/opencharity.zip`, is generated and ready for installation on your Drupal 7 site.
